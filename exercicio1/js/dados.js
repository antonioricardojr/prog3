The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.',

This latest volume in the hugely popular 1001 series surveys the world’s most popular musical instrument.

Never before have so many guitars been profiled within a single illustrated volume, from the earliest Spanish baroque models to the latest Gibson Robot series with computer-controlled self-tuning capabilities and onboard sound-processing features. From the classic and obscure to the simple and high-tech, the most notable guitars from Fender, Ibanez, Epiphone, Les Paul, Martin, and numerous other brands are featured in this one-of-a-kind book. Illustrated with striking color photographs, the book reveals what makes each model special, which well-known musicians use it, and the hit songs in which it can be heard.
